# Robot Management System

## Description

RobotManagementSystem is a REST API that allows clients to communicate with robots. **The specific communication with robots is outside the scope of the API.**

The system provides the following functionalities:

- Registering a robot.
- Registering a medication.
- Loading a robot with medication items.
- Checking loaded medication items for a given robot.
- Checking available robots for loading.
- Check the robot battery level for a given robot.
- Periodic logging of the battery levels of robots into DB.

## Run the project locally

RobotManagementSystem is a Spring Boot application built using Maven. You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work with Java 17 or newer):

```
git clone https://github.com/abdelrahmankhaledg/RobotManagementSystem.git
cd RobotManagementSystem
./mvnw package
java -jar target/robot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  
```

You can access the swagger API documentation at <http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html>. You can also find the postman collection for the API under `src/main/resources/Robot.postman_collection.json`.

## Database Configuration

In its default configuration, RobotManagementSystem uses an in-memory database (H2) which gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is exposed at <http://localhost:8080/h2-console>, and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:robotdb` URL with username "sa" and blank password.
